# jquery.placeholder #

jquery.placeholder is a small [jQuery](http://jquery.com)-based pollyfill for the HTML5 placeholder attribute.

## Usage ##

Just include the script and it takes care of everything. It also patches jQuery's `$.fn.val` function to return an empty value if the actual value matches the placeholder. If you add form fields dynamically to your form just call the `placeholder` function on your element, e.g. `$('input').placeholder()`, to initialize the plugin. The script adds a `placeholder` class to each element that contains a placeholder so you can style it properly.

`$.placeholder.input` and `$.placeholder.textarea` inidcate if the browser has native placeholder support for the two elements.

## Browser support ##

It supports all browsers that do not have native support for the placeholder attribute. Or at least I have not found one where it does not work :).
